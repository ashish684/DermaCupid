**ABOUT**

Derma Cupid is a dating and matchmaking app for people with skin conditions, including vitiligo, psoriasis, acne, eczema, albinism, scar, birthmark and other skin challenges.
At Derma Cupid, we are committed to provide a safe, comfortable and genuine online platform where people with various skin challenges can indulge in open heart communications with like-minded people to explore meaningful connections.
We believe that the people with skin conditions have similar life experiences and challenges, hence, they would understand each other better and rise above the ‘skin’ thing to develop a true companionship based on mutual respect and care.
They would need not to worry about getting judged or rejected due to the skin condition. In fact, the skin condition would never become a matter of conflict because everyone here is in the same boat.
Adults, 18 years and above, can sign up for free and search, interact and a discover a partner for serious relationship, casual dating, friendship or social networking. We expect all the users to be honest, polite and respectful to other users.

**We care for your privacy and safety**

Derma Cupid has been developed by keeping user privacy, safety and comfort as the top priority.
We NEVER share the private information of a user, such as Email address, Facebook account details and Mobile phone number with other users.
We allow the users to HIDE their name so that they can choose to share their name at their own will with other users.
We keep the spammers at bay
Derma Cupid is only for ‘real’ people. Spammers will have a bad luck on Derma Cupid, every time.
Every new user has to verify either of the Facebook account or Mobile phone number at the time of sign up. It helps us to create a verified and authentic profile.
We assign a trust score (20% - 100%) to each account on the basis of verified details. The higher the trust score, more credible the account is.
The team of dedicated moderators monitor various activities round the clock to identify and remove users who are trying to misuse the platform.

Wishing you all the luck in your partner search!
Team Derma Cupid
