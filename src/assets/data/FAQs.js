profiles.

Log in\>\> My Profile\>\> Scroll down to 'Partner Preferences'

**Q: Why I am not seeing relevant, interesting profiles in 'My Matches'

# Likes, Chat requests & messages

A: There is no limit to send Likes and Chat requests per day. However,
we suggest you to send Likes and Chat requests to interesting profiles
only after viewing their full profile details.

**Q: What is the meaning of 'Filtered Out' Likes and chat requests?**

A: Likes and Chat requests from users who do NOT fit into your partner
preference criteria would be shown in the 'Filtered Out' folder.

**Q: I have declined a chat request. How to reply back to that chat request? 

A: In the navigation menu, click on the ‘Declined users’ option to open the 
‘Declined by me’ page. Select the entry that you are looking for and click on 
the ‘Reply’ button to respond back. 


**Q: I have sent many Likes and Chat requests, but not getting
responses. Why so?**

A: There can be numerous reasons for it. Go through the below list of
most probable reasons for not getting enough responses:

-   You have not uploaded a photo yet. Many users prefer to respond
    after seeing the picture of the other user.

-   You do not fit in the partner preference criteria of the other user.
    In that case, your chat request will go into the 'Filtered out'
    folder of the inbox and it reduces the chances of getting a
    response.

-   Your profile bio ('About me' section) is not properly drafted. The
    profile bio gives an impression of your personality. Hence, a poorly
    written bio with too many grammatical errors or spelling mistakes
    will leave a bad impression. Also, writing a very long profile bio
    is not recommended because no one will read it. Keep it precise,
    brief and to the point.

-   Your profile is incomplete with many fields left blank such as
    profile bio, interests and lifestyle choices. Fully complete profile
    with correct information attracts more responses.

-   In some cases, users prefer to respond later if they are not sure
    whether to accept or decline a chat request. In such a scenario,
    it is better to move on and connect with other matching profiles.

**Q: How to receive more Likes and Chat requests?**

A: Please consider the below guidelines to receive more responses:**

-   Add photo(s) to your profile

-   Complete your profile. Do not leave too many fields blank, such as
    Profile bio (About Me), interests and lifestyle habits.

-   Set a broaden partner preference criteria to see more users in the
    'My Matches' page

-   Be proactive and approach new matching profiles.

-   Do not delay in responding to received Likes and Chat requests
