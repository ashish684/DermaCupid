At Derma Cupid, people with skin conditions can join in and connect with other interesting people having similar life experiences. Here, no one will judge you for your skin challenge and you can be extremely comfortable in your skin.
To make the most of this platform and discover your perfect match quickly, we have got a few tips for you:

- **Complete your profile properly**

The signup process will take only a few minutes to complete. So, don’t rush into it. Fill all the information accurately- personal and professional information, lifestyle habits and interests. Be real. Creating a superficial image by entering fake information will not do any good to you. In fact, we will terminate your account as soon as we got to know about this misadventure.

- **Upload photo(s)**

Profile with photos receive three times more likes and responses than those without a profile photo. You can add up to 6 photos to your profile. Upload recently clicked photos only and your face should be clearly visible in all the photos.

- **Update partner preference criteria**

Based on your partner preference criteria, profiles will be shown to you in the ‘My Matches’ section. Hence, it is very crucial to review and update the partner preferences so that relevant matching profiles can be shown to you.

- **Do not leave the Profile bio (‘About me’ section) blank**

The ‘About me’ section allows you a wonderful opportunity to give a brief glimpse of your overall personality to the profile visitors. Also, you can mention the qualities that you are seeking in your partner. Many people don’t bother to fill the ‘About me’ section. They are more interested in browsing matching profiles and sending likes and/or messages to them. Well, this strategy proves counterproductive in most of the cases because the other user wants to know about you before responding to your interest. After signup, you can visit the ‘My Profile’ page to update your profile bio.

- **Maintain a high trust score (80% or above)**

Trust is the foundation of a healthy relationship. A profile with a high trust score attracts more users because it looks more authentic and genuine. A minimum 40% trust score is required to create a profile. But, we highly recommend to maintain a trust score 80% or more for better matchmaking experience.

- **Be regular**

Visit Derma cupid app regularly and respond to newly received likes and chat requests. Also, browse the newly joined matching profiles and initiate conversation with those you like. Regular users are more likely to discover their partner quickly.

- **Be polite and respect others**

Don’t get too desperate during chat. Don’t pressurize other users to share their email address or phone number during initial conversations. Everyone needs some time to build trust so that they can pass on their vital personal information to you. To send abusive or sexually explicit messages is strictly prohibited. If found guilty, you would be banned from our platform.
