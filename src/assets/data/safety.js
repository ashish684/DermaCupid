Your safety is in your hands

You are in full control of your experience at Derma Cupid, and in the interest of your personal safety, we urge you to please follow below safety guidelines. In addition to the below guidelines, we request you to use your own judgement and common sense to protect your security and privacy.

- **Stay alert for money scams**

If a user asks for money, financial support or donations, cut off the communication and &quot;report&#39; that user right away. We remove such fraudulent users immediately to build a genuine and trustworthy community. Never ever share your credit card number, bank account number, or any other crucial financial information with other users.

- **Protect your identity**

Don&#39;t share your key personal information like full name, email address, phone number, home and workplace address, or any other personal information during initial messaging with a user. It is important to know the other member well and build enough trust before revealing your personal information.

- **Go slow; don&#39;t rush into it**

Keep your communications limited to this online dating platform for as much time as you required to build enough trust in the other user. Go to other platforms such as email or phone conversations only when you feel comfortable. Serious and genuine people would understand your concerns and would not push you to communicate off this platform immediately.

- **Request for Profile photo**

If a user doesn&#39;t have a profile photo, request to upload a recent photo. It is absolutely free to upload photos on Derma Cupid. Not only one, but, view several photos of that user to get a more accurate idea of the actual appearance. You may try video calling also to get an exact clue about the looks and physical appearance of that user.

Note: - Derma Cupid doesn&#39;t support video calling. For that, you would need to switch to other platforms.

- **Block and Report the troublemakers**

If you suspect a user is misusing the space, go to profile page of that user to block and/or report. For example:

- users with fraudulent/misleading profile info
- users sending abusive/inappropriate messages
- users promoting their business, products or websites
- additionally, anyone who violates our terms of use and community guidelines

Getting ready for the first offline meeting

The beauty of online dating platform lies in the facility of communication so that you can know each other well before getting to meet in person.

Before the first offline meeting, it is important to know each other&#39;s personal and professional info, the nature of the skin condition, hobbies and interests and the family background. Additionally, a few sessions of video calling will ensure you don&#39;t get shocked by any unwanted surprise when meeting in person.

Consider below precautions to stay safe when meeting in person:

- **Choose a public place for meeting**

Meet and stay in a public place such as a restaurant or a coffee shop. Private locations like a hotel room or house or apartment should be avoided by all means.

- **Inform your family and/or friends about your meet in advance**

Tell a friend or a family member about your plan in detail- when and where you are going and by when you will return. You may share the name, phone number and address of the person you are going to meet with that close confidante. Keep your cell phone with you all the times, properly charged and working.

- **Arrange your own transportation for the meeting**

For the first meeting, don&#39;t ask that person to pick you up or drop you back. You should be independent and in control of your to and fro transportation.

- **Stay away from alcohol and other drugs**

Stay sober and say no to alcohol or other sedative drugs that may put you in danger. Be alert if your date is trying to spike your beverage with any synthetic substance to take advantage.

Note: - Contact the police in your area if find yourself in immediate danger.
